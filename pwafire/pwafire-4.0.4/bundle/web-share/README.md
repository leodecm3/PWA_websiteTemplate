### What is the Web Share Target API?
The Web Share Target API allows installed web apps to register with the underlying OS as a share 
target to receive shared content from either the Web Share API or system events, like the OS-level share button.

Web Share Target is currently supported on Android in Chrome 71 or later. Both Mozilla and Microsoft 
have indicated their support but have not implemented it yet.
