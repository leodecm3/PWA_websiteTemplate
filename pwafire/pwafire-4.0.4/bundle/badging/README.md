### What is the Badging API?

>Dogfood: The design of the Badging API is still being altered, and it’s not available in the browser yet. The sample code you see below, is based on the current design, and will likely change between now and the time it lands in the browser.

The Badging API is a new web platform API that allows installed web apps to set an application-wide badge.
Badges tend to be more user friendly than notifications, and can be updated with a much higher frequency, 
since they don’t interrupt the user. And, because they don’t interrupt the user, there’s no special 
permission needed to use them.
